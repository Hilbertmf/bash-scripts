After cloning the repository you have to make the files executable. You can do it with the following command:
```
chmod +x filename.sh
```
You can then execute it like this if you're at the same directory of the file:
```
./filename.sh
```
If you're at another directory you do like this:
```
~/scripts/filename.sh
```
